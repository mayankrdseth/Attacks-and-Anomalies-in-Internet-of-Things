# Attacks-and-Anomalies-in-Internet-of-Things

Attacks and Anomalies in Internet of Things							       Dec’20 – Jan’21

Self-Project | Tool: PyTorch, Python

To automate the process of detecting anomalies and attacks in IOTs using various machine learning techniques

•	Dealt with R2L and U2R attacks detecting threats via their behavioural deviation from regular user traffic 

•	Implemented hybrid models (principal component analysis, ensemble classifiers) to detect anomalies & threats

•	Modified and tested the ensemble classifier architecture to deal with the noise in the NSL-KDD dataset
